Image/video hosting backend server application aiming for simple but rich feature support for both picture & video distribution across the web.

## NOTE
This is similar to my previous project (https://github.com/StrateimTech/Open-MediaServer) which is an all-in-one sollution hosting both the backend and frontend in the same application on the other hand this project is focused on a more modular approach to the issue raised by separating both the frontend and backend allowing for a greater emphasis on multi application support (web, windows, android, etc).

### Further up
A little more information on this project
* The backend server can independently run on and serve content without needing a frontend.
* At the current state this project is not functional for production use. 
* This project has similar goals to the production product of Open-MediaServer.
* For the future maybe make a frontend such as a desktop application or web server?

## Main dependencies
* Utoipa / Swagger
* Rocket
* Sled

## Other
This is a learning project for me with rust, any help is appreciated.
